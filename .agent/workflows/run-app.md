description: How to run the Cyberpunk Sudoku application
---

To run the application, follow these steps:

1. **Resolve Dependencies**: Ensure all packages are installed.
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

2. **List Devices**: Check which devices are available (emulators, web, or desktop).
   ```bash
   flutter devices
   ```

3. **Run the App**: Execute the run command. If you have multiple devices, you may need to specify one using `-d <device-id>`.
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

4. **Desktop (Windows)**: If you want to run it specifically as a Windows desktop app:
   ```bash
   flutter run -d windows
   ```
